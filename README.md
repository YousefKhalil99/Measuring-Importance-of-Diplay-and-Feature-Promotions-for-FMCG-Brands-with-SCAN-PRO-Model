# Measuring-Importance-of-Diplay-and-Feature-Promotions-for-FMCG-Brands-with-SCAN-PRO-Model
Consumer brands invest significant time and resources to promote their products with advertisements and in-store promotions. It is important for these companies to measure the effect of their marketing activities on their sales to optimize their revenues. It is also useful to build models which can accurately forecast sales as a function of promotions. Brands in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry particularly benefit from these practices as it is a very competitive industry with millions of products sold. Companies such as P&amp;G, Unilever, and KraftHeinz need to develop accurate and reliable models to forecast sales and tailor their in-store promotional strategies. The SCAN*PRO model performs well under such tasks.  For this report, we will use the SCAN*PRO model to measure the effect of display and feature promotions on sales of 4 brands across 4 different supermarket product categories: packaged snacks, cereals, frozen pizza, and oral hygiene products. We will pick 1 underperfoming brand from each category for our analysis and forecast sales after applying the SCAN*PRO model. We will also investigate which type of stores are better suited for each brandâ€™s products. This report will help each of the 4 brands assess their in-store promotional strategies, optimize their sales revenues, and gain market share.
